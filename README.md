# Utput_Assignment-1
Hi,

I have chosen problem no 2 from the assignment.

In this program, ADC channel 1, 3, 8, and 9 are being read one by one. This data is printed on UART.
UART data is received via UART interrup function. Received data is stored into an variable st, which is changing the sampling speed as required.
Program is tested on stm32 discovery board.
